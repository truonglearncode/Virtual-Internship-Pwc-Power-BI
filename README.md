Hi there,

This project has been a fantastic opportunity for me to delve into various presentation techniques and leverage Power BI to create a dashboard that addresses real business challenges. Throughout the project, I've gained valuable insights into defining key performance indicators (KPIs), creating effective visualizations with Power BI, and confidently identifying problem insights, discussing potential root causes, and making informed recommendations.

I'm now equipped to use Power BI to design insightful and visually appealing dashboards for any business problem I encounter in the future. To further enhance my skills, I plan to deepen my understanding of Power BI's capabilities for handling large datasets and creating easy-to-understand visualizations. Additionally, I'll continue to expand my knowledge of various business aspects to make more effective and contextually relevant business decisions.

I have successfully completed this project and earned a certificate. Should you have any inquiries or require additional information regarding this project, please feel free to reach out to me. I am available to provide any necessary assistance

Truong Ngo
